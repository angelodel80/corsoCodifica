Hello!

Welcome to the code files for Beginning XSLT and XPath.

In this zip file you will find all the files needed for the examples in the book itself. When you extract the zip archive, you will have a set of folders named ch01, ch02, etc, one for each chapter in the book. 

Thank you and enjoy!
