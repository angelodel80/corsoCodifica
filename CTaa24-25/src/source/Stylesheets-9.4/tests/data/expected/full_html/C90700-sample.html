            <b>Description: </b>Relief panel of medium-grained white marble; composed from three pieces, 
                              the upper left-hand corner lost, all edges chipped, the surface encrusted as well as worn away in places
                              (w 0.415 x h 0.34 x d 0.063 ; depth of relief  0.029). The relief as a whole presents a male figure on horseback 
                              (both man and horse damaged), riding rightwards towards a draped woman and a boy (damaged) who stand beside a cylindrical altar; behind the 
                              boy there is an inscribed stele with conical top, and under the horse a snake which uncoils and reaches towards the altar. A dowel hole (depth 
                              0.015, diameter 0.007) by the right leg of the boy may have served to attach the horse’s front leg to the background.  </p>

         <h3>Commentary </h3>
         <p>The figure on horseback, who may be pictured as an ephebe or a neos, is clearly deceased, and I take the stele to represent his funerary monument which, with the altar dedicated to a funerary cult, will have stood in the courtyard in front of his tomb, in the manner common in the Cyrene cemeteries, at any rate until early in the second century A.D. The courtyard normally also contained a half-figure of a mourning woman and the female figure here may represent her.</p>
         <p>In the inscription the deceased is named and described as <span class="lang" lang="grc">ἥρως</span>, hero, i.e. a superhuman post mortem existence is attributed to him, as also to the subject of <a target="_blank" href="c90900.html">C90900</a>. Given the relief and its dedication in the Sanctuary (if that is really to be accepted - but it is to be remembered that it was found in what might be described as a dump into which many stones from the adjacent cemetery might have been swept), this divinisation deserves to be regarded as a genuine and comforting belief by his surviving family.</p>
         <p> A dedication of this kind in the Sanctuary presumably indicates that in some part thereof Kore’s identity with Persephone (locally Persephatta) as Queen of the Underworld was a feature of the cult.</p>
         <p>It should be noted that the names preserve in Cyrenaean dialect forms (<span class="lang" lang="grc">Θευ-</span> for <span class="lang" lang="grc">Θεο</span>- and -<span class="lang" lang="grc">ω</span> for -<span class="lang" lang="grc">ου</span> in the genitive singular masculine).</p>
