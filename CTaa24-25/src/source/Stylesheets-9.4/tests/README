The tests make use of Python's subprocess module to call out to the OS
to run Saxon to perform XSL transformations. This requires that you
have Saxon installed on your system, and that the appropriate JAR file
is on the class path. See
http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/#!about/installationjava/installingjava

Test scripts are written in Python 3. Run all tests (from this or
the parent directory) with 'python3 -m unittest' or equivalent.
